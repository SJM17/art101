			<h1>Lab 16 - JSON and APIs (XKCD Comic!)</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to experiment with processing JSON from an API. In this 
						case we took a comic book script and made it output onto our page.
					</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> One of the problems we ran into with this lab was getting the actual image of the comic
                        to appear. The image was necessary to be able to even view the comic, so this was a major issue.
                        However, we were able to figure out how to add the comic image using the variable comicIMG and attributes
                        that we found through W3Schools. We had forgotten to actually append the image to get it to appear.

					</p> 
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>While we ran into a small hiccup with grabbing the comic's image we felt that this lab went relatively
                        smooth for us. We felt as though the previous labs and what we have learned throughout the quarter allowed
                        us to finish this lab with ease.
