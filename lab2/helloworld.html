        <h1>Hello World</h1>
                <p>Hello we are Isabelle and Sophie! I'm Isabelle and I am a 2nd year AGPM major 
                planning to add FDM as a double major. I have no programming experience but I am 
                looking forward to learn through this class and add coding into my skillset. In my 
                free time I like to draw, cook, and  play video games. I love cats and red pandas 
                and I have a cat named Tabby!</p> 
                       
                <p>I'm Sophie and I am also a 2nd year AGPM major, planning to minor in FDM! The only 
                programming experience I have is in Python from high school so I'm not too experienced. 
                However, I hope to learn a lot about coding so that I can better communicate with 
                programmers in the future when I'm in the game design industry. A few hobbies of mine 
                are video games, creative writing, skiing, crochet, and reading manhwa. I have 3  
                cats back at home named Daisy, Dixie, and Olive but I hope to have my own cat one 
                day as well! </p>
