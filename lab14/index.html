			<h1>Lab 14 - Debugging Tools & Strategies</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> The challenge of this lab was to look back at other labs from this quarter and 
						debug them so that they work properly.		
					</p>
				</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The biggest issue we ran into was the fact that we did not have any labs that actually 
						needed to be debugged. However, the Task X bonus was vague and confusing. The first point 
						was to experiment with debugger to create breakpoints in our code. We weren't entirely sure 
						what that meant or what it entailed. We also looked into the second option, however, everyone 
						on stackoverflow is asking questions that we could not answer given our short time in this class. 
						As such, we decided to tackle an old Task X that had bothered us from Lab 8. 
					</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> Since this lab was very different from the others it was certainly confusing. Despite 
						the obstacles we faced in where to begin, we were proud that we were able to revisit an 
						old lab and make an improvement upon it thanks to the knowledge we gained throughout the 
						quarter. As we are much more used to coding in HTML, CSS, and JS now the Task X of lab 8 
						didn't appear as daunting as before. And we were able to figure it out quickly.

						This was the Task X for Lab 8 that my partner and I originally attempted.
                        We had given up after a while. However, for Lab 14 we didn't have any other
                        labs to debug, but we really wanted to revisit an old Task X. In this case, the
                        challenge was to get the console output to appear on the actual webpage instead
                        in just the console. To fix this error we re-wrote all the console.log commands
                        we had and turned them into an outputHTML that would actually display them. We also
                        kept the original console.log as tests that could still be viewed by going into the
                        console. We made sure to set the output div's content so it would display the various
                        test.
