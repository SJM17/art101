			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to further develop a local file structure on my computer
						and add index.html files. Then uploard those files to te server so that they can be
						seen on my website/browser.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One of the main problems that arose for me was actually when it came to adding
					a selfie of myself to my homepage. I actually found out how to get my image added quite quickly
					however, the image was massive on the page. I had trouble making it smaller despite using the CSS
					provided in the Lab. It was only until I found out that that I needed to change "img class" to "img id"
					in my index.html file was I able to apply the edit to the image to make it smaller. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I feel that this assignment/lab went pretty well. I defintel took my time looking into
					the technicalities of the html code. As well as taking my time to experiment with CSS to
					make my page look nice. Or well, atleast tried to make it look nice. It took a lot of back
					and forth to get it to a point I was happy with. But regardless I enjoyed this lab as I further
					explored HTML and CSS.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Here is the result. You can see the index.html file I created as well as the file structure:</p>
					<img src="img/filestructureimage.png" width="300">
