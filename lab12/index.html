			<h1>Lab 12 - Conditionals</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> The challenge of this lab was to create a function that depended on conditionals.
						In this case we added an input field that would take someone's name and sort them 
						into a certain bending type from Avatar: The Last Airbender.
					</p>
				</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> One of the problems we ran into for this lab was getting the function to actually run
						and output the house information after a user input their name. We came to find that 
						clicking submit did not do anything. As such, we debugged our code from there and found
						that the sortingHat function had not been called correctly in our click handler for the 
						submit button. So we made sure to "let house = sortingHat" in order to correctly output 
						the house information.
					</p> 
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> Overall we are pleased with how this lab went. We had a lot of fun trying to decide 
						what houses/fandom we were going to use for sorting user inputs. We even added a short 
						description of each bending style after users are sorted. We ran into a few minor problems 
						but we were able to work through them all by looking at previous labs and our class notes.
						We even included a font change to the output from within the JavaScript to make the text 
						stand out.
