			<h1>Lab 7 - Functions</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab we had to write a function that took user input and manipulated a string.
						In this case we made it so a user is prompted to write in their name, the code takes that
						input and basically mixes it up to create a "new name".
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> We didn't really run into any major problems for the main part of this lab.
						We were able to follow the assignment closely and get the user input and everything
						else working. There were some minor errors that came with simply typing out the
						code we needed in JavaScript. But they were minor troubleshooting errors like mistyped
						properties and missed semicolons.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>We are very pleased with how this lab went. It went fairly smooth and the
						end result was what was seen on the assignment example. It was satisfying to see
						the pop up asking for the user input when we refreshed the page.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
						<p> Here are the results! You are looking at the index.html file I created and the program execution: </p>
						<h2>Script Output</h2>
