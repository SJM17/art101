			<h1>Lab 10 - JavaScript for the Web</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> The challenge of this lab was to experiment with DOM manipulation. With the main goal of this
						lab being to create a button that, when clicked, generated random "conversation". In this case 
						we used a little bit of the "Lorem Ipsum" paragraph to generate the random conversation.
					</p>
				</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One of the problems we ran into with this lab was getting the button to actually
						work when clicked. In the beginning, we found that when clicking it, nothing happened.
						That's when we found out that we hadn't actually put our event listener callback and output appendage
						INSIDE the clicker button function. In the instructions for the lab it looks like the function just ends,
						but steps 4 and 5 actually needed to be put inside the function made in step 3.
					</p> 
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> We are happy with how this lab turned out. While we ran into a little hiccup with getting the button to
						work, we managed to figure it out in the end by placing the right things inside the clicker function.
						We were also able to do one half of Task X, we found that the user input section was a bit too complicated.
						However, we were able to make the text generate side to side like a real text conversation. We even styled 
						the text too!
