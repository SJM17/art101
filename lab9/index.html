			<h1>Lab 9 - Libraries and jQuery</h1>
			<div id="challenge" class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to experiment with
						jQuery. The goal of the lab was to include a button
						under each section of the lab that would change the look
						of the section to a special CSS included in the lab.
					</p>

			<div id="problem" class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One of the major problems we ran into with this lab was
						actually getting the buttons to appear on our page. The lab
						states that we needed to have jQuery loaded for it to work, however
						nothing would show up even after following lab instructions. Thats
						when we realized there was no way the Javascript could "pull" anything
						just from the header titles in our HTML file to append a working button.
						We found out that we needed to actually add a ID to the div of each section
						if we wanted to actually tie a button to it back in the Javascript file.
					</p> 
			</div>

			<div id="reflection" class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>We are happy with how this lab went despite the frustration
						we faced when it came to getting jQuery to work. We just wished
						the instructions were a little more clear on how to link the
						JavaScript commands to the items in our HTML code.
